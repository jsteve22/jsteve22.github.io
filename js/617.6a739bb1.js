Our goal was to create a simple text editor that would be more intuitive for students to use when working on remote machines. This was our second course where we had to program, and we were working on linux machines using ssh. Students were told to use vim to edit files, which caused many problems for some students as they had issues with the keymappings. So VPP would be a text editor similar to windows programs where you would save with ctrl-s or quit with ctrl-q. In this project I learned about raw vs cooked terminal modes and how to use color control sequences to display custom text colors for different keywords. In this project, I learned about the importance of organizing work amongst the workers.

Post quantum cryptography is a new set of encryption schemes that will be safe against quantum attacks. Some current public key encyprtion schemes, like RSA, are vulnerable to quantum algorithms, specifically Shor's algorithm. While there are not quantum computers that are powerful enough to post a threat to current encryption schemes, we can expect that in the next few years there could be strong enough quantum computers. With this threat, there is a push to standardize new public key encryption schemes that would not be vulnerable to quantum computers. Newer schemes for a post quantum world are being decided by NIST. My project would analyze a developers directory to see if they are using any unsafe functions that would be vulnerable to quantum attacks. I analyzed the version of cryptography library being used and would search through their code for vulnerable function calls. The tool would print out where any potential threats are and allow for the user to update their library. This project was to focus on the potential threat quantum computers pose to current public key encryption schemes and how we would have to change our code to keep it safe in the future.
